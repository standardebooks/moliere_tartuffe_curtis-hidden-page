									<span>All the more dangerous, since in their anger</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They use against us weapons men revere,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And since they make the world applaud their passion,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And seek to stab us with a sacred sword.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There are too many of this canting kind.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Still, the sincere are easy to distinguish;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And many splendid patterns may be found,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In our own time, before our very eyes</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Look at Ariston, Periandre, Oronte,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Alcidamas, Clitandre, and Polydore;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>No one denies their claim to true religion;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet they’re no braggadocios of virtue,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They do not make insufferable display,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And their religion’s human, tractable;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They are not always judging all our actions,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They’d think such judgment savoured of presumption;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, leaving pride of words to other men,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>’Tis by their deeds alone they censure ours.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Evil appearances find little credit</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With them; they even incline to think the best</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of others. No caballers, no intriguers,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They mind the business of their own right living.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They don’t attack a sinner tooth and nail,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For sin’s the only object of their hatred;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor are they overzealous to attempt</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Far more in heaven’s behalf than heaven would have ’em.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That is my kind of man, that is true living,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That is the pattern we should set ourselves.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Your fellow was not fashioned on this model;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>You’re quite sincere in boasting of his zeal;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But you’re deceived, I think, by false pretences.</span>
