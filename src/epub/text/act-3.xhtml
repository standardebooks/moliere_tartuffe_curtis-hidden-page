									<span>Though pious, I am nonetheless a man;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And when a man beholds your heavenly charms,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The heart surrenders, and can think no more.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I know such words seem strange, coming from me;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But, madam, I’m no angel, after all;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If you condemn my frankly made avowal</span>
									<br/>
									<span>You only have your charming self to blame.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Soon as I saw your more than human beauty,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>You were thenceforth the sovereign of my soul;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sweetness ineffable was in your eyes,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That took by storm my still resisting heart,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And conquered everything, fasts, prayers, and tears,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And turned my worship wholly to yourself.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My looks, my sighs, have spoke a thousand times;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now, to express it all, my voice must speak.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If but you will look down with gracious favour</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon the sorrows of your worthless slave,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If in your goodness you will give me comfort</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And condescend unto my nothingness,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I’ll ever pay you, O sweet miracle,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>An unexampled worship and devotion.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then too, with me your honour runs no risk;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With me you need not fear a public scandal.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>These court gallants, that women are so fond of,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Are boastful of their acts, and vain in speech;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They always brag in public of their progress;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Soon as a favour’s granted, they’ll divulge it;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Their tattling tongues, if you but trust to them,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Will foul the altar where their hearts have worshipped.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But men like me are so discreet in love,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That you may trust their lasting secrecy.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The care we take to guard our own good name</span>
									<br/>
									<span>May fully guarantee the one we love;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So you may find, with hearts like ours sincere,</span>

									<span>Love without scandal, pleasure without fear.</span>
