									<span>A scoundrel known before by other names,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Our monarch⁠—to resolve you in a word⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Detesting his ingratitude and baseness,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Added this horror to his other crimes,</span>

									<span>Your papers, which the traitor says are his,</span>

									<span>I am to take from him, and give you back;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The deed of gift transferring your estate</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Our monarch’s sovereign will makes null and void;</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Your friend involved you in, he pardons you:</span>

									<span>How well his heart, when it is least expected,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Knows how to recompense a noble deed,</span>
